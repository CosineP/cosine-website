			<p>
				Hi -
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm Luna Phipps-Costin. On my <a href="/resume">homepage</a>,
				you can find your way to
				all of my projects, including software tools, many games, and contributions to
				Mozilla Firefox.
				But I wanted to give you an interactive look at some of my
				favourite projects, so I made this page for you.

			<h3><a class="wild" href="https://cosinegaming.com/flip">Flip</a></h3>
			<p>
				It’s one of my favorite games
				I’ve made. Your character is that blue “R,” and your goal is to
				make it to the green “R.” Clicking on one of those black bars
				reflects your character over that axis.
			</p>
			<p class="no-print">
				The game is embedded to the left.
			</p>
			<p>This is an interesting
				problem, because it asks the player to find the solution
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter_group">Coxeter
				group</a>, given certain possible reflections. Moreover, I had to
				learn the mathematics of reflections in a way that I can present
				it in a puzzle game without sounding like math!
			</p>
			<p>
				Another fun thing to point out is the code used to calculate the “R”s’
				positions. All of the reflections are calculated using
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication">
					Matrix
					multiplication</a>
				(so the browser can render the transformation). Here’s
				<a href="https://github.com/CosineGaming/flip/blob/master/game.js#L591-L597">
					the Javascript</a>
				I used to calculate these matrices:
			</p>
			<pre>
var b = line[1] - m*line[0];
var q1 = m + (1 / m);
var q2 = 1 + m*m; // ...
flip = new SVG.Matrix(
	2/m/q1 - 1, 2*m/q2,
	2/q1, 2*m*m/q2 - 1,
	-2*b/q1, 2*b/q2);

			<h3><a class="wild big-text" href="https://cosinegaming.com/entropy">Entropy</a></h3>
			<p>
				I made this game for <a href="http://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare</a>,
				a "game jam" in which people make games in 48 hours about a
				specific theme, and share them with each other. This theme was <i>One Room</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				My idea was to make a dungeon crawler where, instead of
				advancing to other rooms, you advance to different energy levels of the same
				room. The higher energy levels are more difficult to survive in.
			</p>
			<p>
				I really enjoyed what I made, so I continued to work on it. I
				fixed some bugs and made it support touch fully, so that it
				could be used on mobile phones.
			</p>
			<p class="no-print">
				It's embedded to the left. Use the arrow keys to move around,
				and click in a direction to shoot. When you're ready, go to one of those blue
				portals and hold <code>E</code> to advance to the next energy level.

			<h3><a class="wild big-text" href="https://cosinegaming.com/swarm/">Swarm</a></h3>
			<p>
				I made this game for <a href="http://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare</a> as well;
				this theme was <i>You are the enemy</i>. I wanted to make a
				game where you don't have the "hero's advantage" you have in many games -
				you're just another grunt, more likely to die than anyone else. To do this, I
				made it so that you were amongst a huge swarm of enemies, and upon dying your
				consciousness transferred to another member of the swarm. This
				made balance interesting, because you play a small - but still significant! -
				part in the outcome of the game.
			</p>
			<p>
				For this game I wanted to focus on making the game <i>feel</i>
				"juicy." So I focused on making the graphics fun (I used pastel colors of pink
				and cyan), and added some fun sound effects. I especially liked my way of
				making subtle screenshot to make your shots feel powerful.
			</p>
			<p class="no-print">
				It's embedded to the left. Use the keys <code>WSAD</code> as arrow keys to move around,
				and click in a direction to shoot. You must kill the blue square-ish thing
				(a <code>Triflapper</code>)
